    We can access the elements in the DOM by 5 methods

    <h3>1)getElementById()</h3>
    In order to be accessed by ID, the HTML element must have an id attribute.
    It is the easy method to access the unique elements effectively.
    <br></br>

    <h3>2)getElementsByClassName()</h3>
    The class attribute is used to access one or more specific elements in the DOM. 
    We can get all the elements with a given class name with the getElementsByClassName() method.
    <br></br>

    <h3>3)getElementsByTagName()</h3>
    A less specific way to access multiple elements on the page would be by its HTML tag name. 
    We access an element by tag with the getElementsByTagName() method.
    <br></br>

    <h3>4)querySelector()</h3>
    To access a single element, we will use the querySelector() method. 
    querySelector() will return the first element that matches the query.
    <br></br>

    <h3>5)querySelectorAll()</h3>
    In the case of a selector with multiple elements, such as a class or a tag, querySelector() will return the first element that matches the query.
     We can use the querySelectorAll() method to collect all the elements that match a specific query.
